 * Central export index for all Drizzle ORM schema definitions.
 * We import each table definition from its respective file and export them
 * so that the rest of the application can reference them easily.
 *
 * @notes
 * - Make sure to re-export anything that needs to be accessed elsewhere (e.g. the enum definitions).
